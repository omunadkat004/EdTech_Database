# SQL Database Project - Semester 4

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a structured SQL database with **15+ entries**, showcasing various SQL functionalities. The database was designed, implemented, and queried using **Oracle LiveSQL** as part of our **Semester 4 curriculum**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)
- **Oracle LiveSQL** (Cloud-based SQL execution environment)

## 📂 Project Features
✔️ **Database Creation**: Designed a relational database with structured tables and appropriate data types.  
✔️ **Data Insertion**: Inserted 15+ records covering various real-world scenarios.  
✔️ **Data Retrieval**: Utilized **SELECT** queries, **WHERE** conditions, **ORDER BY**, and **GROUP BY**.  
✔️ **Advanced Queries**: Used **JOINS**, **AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS**, **SUBQUERIES**, and **VIEWS** for complex data retrieval.  
✔️ **Data Manipulation**: Performed **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, and **ALTER** operations.  
✔️ **Constraints & Indexing**: Implemented **PRIMARY KEY**, **FOREIGN KEY**, and **INDEXES** for optimization.  



## 📊 Sample Queries
```sql
-- Retrieve all records
SELECT * FROM table_name;

-- Find records with specific criteria
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'Value';

-- Join two tables
SELECT A.column1, B.column2 FROM TableA A JOIN TableB B ON A.id = B.id;
```
